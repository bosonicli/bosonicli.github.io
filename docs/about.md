This is bosonicli's first trial on personal blog.

About Mathematics / Physics / Information Society / Ideology / Economy , etc. In short, everything about connection between my subjective world and the objective world.

This blog is based on (automatic) [Github-Pages][Github-Pages] service and [jekyll][jekyllrb] website tool.

You can find documentation and source code for Jekyll at [jekyll-Github][jekyll-Github] or [jekyllrb][jekyllrb], and guide for Github-pages service at [Github-Pages][Github-Pages].

You can contact me via my Github account [bosonicli-Github][bosonicli-Github] or by mail [bosonicli-Gmail][bosonicli-Gmail].

Wish you enjoy wandering on my blog :)
