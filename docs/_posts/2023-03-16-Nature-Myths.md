+   'proton size: inconsistency of s-wave'?

+   'cross section approaches linear at UV'?

# thought experiment

	temperature scale: water triple point

	length scale: spectrum wavelength

## start with mountain height

+   Xiao-Gang Wen

+   discussion with Zhuo-Xiao Wang

	planet size and temperature

+   invisibility

	submarine, optical invisibility and conductivity of water

+   env for carbon-based lifeform

## other

+   a spoon of electron

+   high-density air

	fundamental medium matter

	fundamental framework element

# Mathematics

+   Axiom of Choice

	Hausdorff ball

+   indefinable real numbers

+   Three crisis of mathematics

	proposed in Leninism society to demonstrate the evolution of science

	not necessarily three

# Quantum

+   Non-unirarity of quantum collapse

+   delayed eraser

+   collapse 'is not an event'?

# Field Theory

+   EM field in higher dimension

	E & M field no longer dual?

# HydroDynamics

+   Fluid Roche limit

+   Waterball without gravity

	ossilation?

# Astronomy

+   Magnetic Field

	Solar wind dynamics in geomagnetic field is plasma dynamics rather than single particle one

	Solar wind + solar magnetic field also blocks space rays

+   Atmospheric Optics

	absorption

	scattering

	Ionosphere Dynamics

# Cosmology

+   Redshift as physical quantity

+   Scale invariance

	expression of space of light

+   Penrose Conformal Cyclic Cosmology

+	de-Sitter Universe

# ThermoDynamics

+   'Available Energy', appearing along with Entropy in most cases, correspond to Gibbs free energy

# Gravity

## Gravitational Wave

+   coupling of gravitational wave?

	with mass / gravitational waves / black holes

	gravitational wave diffraction around black hole

+   curve of spacetime is nonlinear, 'gravitational wave' is just the linear asymptotic

+   vaccum with nonzero cosmological constant is itself a momentum medium, it has E-P density

+   it is not wierd that $( 1 + \lambda (x+y)^2 )^{\frac{1}{2}}$ has a $xy \times o(\lambda^2)$ term

## mass myth

+   'gravitational mass' in classical equations is defined through energy/force

	then blocked by the fact that energy is not well defined in curved spacetime

+   The only meaningful connection is through E-P tensor and Einstein equation $S = \sqrt{-h} S_{flat}$

+   asymptotically mass could be treated as source of 'gravity' $(h - h_{flat})$

## energy of gravity system

+   how much energy is released in a collapsing celestial

	an extreme case is 'black hole bomb', which 'release energy' to an asymptotic flat spacetime

	then blocked by the fact that energy is not well defined in curved spacetime

# Black Hole

## Black Hole Geometry

+   Black hole has no volume

	It has only area, just like the line on the tennis has no area but only length

	decuction: all mass of black hole is stored on surface --- surface information hypo --- holographic universe hypo

+   Killing Vector

	how to comprehend the time/space Killing Vector?

## Black Hole as a Celestial

+   Dark region is larger than the horizon

## Black Hole ThermoDynamics

+   Hawking Radiation

	black hole evaporate V.S. Background Radiation

	mass-temp relation, critical mass/size

+   Does black hole has a characteristic scale? Does the Penrose CCC hypo require all black holes vaporized?

+   mass of a Schwarzmann black hole is proportional to area. But black hole thermodynamics is derived from energy extration in Penrose process of Kerr black hole. What's meaningful in black hole thermodynamics $\delta M = \frac{\kappa}{8 \pi G} \delta A + \Omega_{H} \delta J$ is surface gravity $\kappa = \frac{\partial M}{\partial A} \propto \frac{1}{M}$

+   What is mass

	Irreducible mass is area sqrt $M_{irr}^2 = \frac{A}{16 \pi G^2}$

	mass is E-P tensor, E-P is invariant of spacetime invariance, but black hole is curved spacetime

	is it related to 'gravity is entropy force'

	is Penrose process also related to entropy / free energy

# Dynamics

## fragment

+   orbit stability

	Bertland Theorem

+   sunshine duration

+   effective gravity induced by rotation of facility

	Only second-order effect is present at a perturbative level

+   epicycle model

	Fitting Kepler orbit of binary celestial system to epicycle system?

+   'Lagrangian points' for ellipse orbit?

	actually this is about finding a stable orbit instead of a point

+   space channel in gravitational fields

	More fictional rather than a realistic one. Few materials are found

+   Hydrogen and $SO(4)$ symmetry

	Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector does not necessarily commute with angular momentum $L$ in the $\mathcal{L}$ notion. It is conserved given that $\mathcal{H}$ is time-independent. In other words, it is invariant under a different (more strict) variational condition.

+   action / time evolution

	Time evolution operators classically (failed)

Galois (1811-1832)

The first modern and more precise definition of a vector space was introduced by Peano in 1888;[5] by 1900, a theory of linear transformations of finite-dimensional vector spaces had emerged. Linear algebra took its modern form in the first half of the twentieth century, when many ideas and methods of previous centuries were generalized as abstract algebra.

In 1879, Frobenius introduced the term “rank” to designate the order of the largest non-evanescent minor in an array of numbers.
